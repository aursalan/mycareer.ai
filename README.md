# Mycareer.ai 

> This project is an intelligent, two-mode career guidance platform that uses AI and Machine Learning to recommend ideal occupations.

- It provides personalized career recommendations based on users' personality traits (OCEAN), interests (RIASEC), and educational background.

- The system features two distinct modes: a questionnaire-based mode for structured input and a free-text mode that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) for analysis.

- It employs advanced techniques like cosine similarity, TF-IDF, sentence-transformers, and PCA to map user profiles against the comprehensive O*NET occupation database.

- The platform is built with a modern, scalable architecture, featuring a modular backend and persistent storage with MongoDB.
